Updating driver
===============

The following modifications have been made to this code to integrate it with the
Intel® DPDK:


e1000_osdep.h and e1000_osdep.c
-------------------------------

The OS dependency layer has been extensively modified to support the drivers in
the Intel® DPDK environment. It is expected that these files will not need to be
changed on updating the driver.
